    <h2>About HTML</h2>
    <p><i><b>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</b></i> is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. With          Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for the World Wide Web. Web browsers receive
    HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render them into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web
    page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>
